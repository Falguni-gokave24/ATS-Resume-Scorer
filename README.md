# ATS-Resume-Scorer
Resume ATS Scorer is a mini project that simulates how Applicant Tracking Systems evaluate resumes. It compares a resume with a job description using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to generate an ATS score and identify missing skills through a Flask-based backend with a simple frontend.
